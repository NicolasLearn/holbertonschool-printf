                        printf - man page

NAME
    
    printf - print formatted

SYNOPSIS

    #include <stdio.h>
    int printf(const char *format, ...)

DESCRIPTION

    printf is a standard C library function used for formatted output. 
    It stands for "print formatted" and is designed to display information 
    on the console or write it to a file in a specific, well-formatted way.

    c
        the %c format specifier is used to display a character. 
        When you use %c in the format string, you must provide an additional argument 
        that represents the value of the character to display.

    s
        %s: This is a format specifier for a character string.
        %s format is used to specify where a string should be inserted 
        into the format string.
        You can use %s to print the contents of any string, 
        whether it is a static string or a dynamically allocated dynamic string.
    
    %
        %% is used to display a single percent character ("%"). 
        %% in printf is a loophole to literally display the percent character, 
        rather than interpreting it as the start of a format specifier.

    d, i
        The %d and %i format specifiers are used to display integer values (whole numbers). 
        These specifiers are interchangeable, meaning that %d and %i can be used 
        interchangeably to display integer values.
